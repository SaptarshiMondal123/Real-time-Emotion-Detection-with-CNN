# Real-time-Emotion-Detection-with-CNN
This repository hosts code for a real-time emotion detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN model classifies facial expressions into seven emotion categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. The model is implemented in TensorFlow and Keras, trained on the FER-2013 dataset.
